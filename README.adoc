= Theme park

Theme park is an project experience don't use it in production !
This project allow you to manipulate and orchestrate thread tasks, and teach you how implement distributed computation in java.

The project is built on vert.x library and I personnaly chose reactive programming pattern on the implementation.
The main purpose you have an interface to implement, Theme park understand it and orchestrate it.

You don't have to worry about Thread parking, IO, safepoint and stop. Theme park is in charge of this.
